*This is a submission for the [GitHub Copilot Challenge ](https://dev.to/challenges/github): Fresh Starts*

## What I Built

A Vue web app that incorporates Github Model (ChatGPT-4o mini) to analyze and answer questions about NSW property data

## Demo
<!-- Share a link to your app and include some screenshots, gifs, or videos here. -->

## Repo
<!-- Embed your public github repository here. -->

## Copilot Experience
<!-- Describe how you used Copilot throughout the development process, including prompts, edits, chat, autocomplete, model switcher, etc. -->

## GitHub Models

This project made extensive use of Github Copilot as outlined below

### Copilot Chat

* the script to download the raw property price is generated by Copilot Chat using the prompt "create me a script that can be run in any OS (maybe make use of npm?) that can be used to download file from this link https://www.valuergeneral.nsw.gov.au/__psi/yearly/2024.zip and save it to local folder (same folder as current active) and unzip". I just need to make modifications so it can download more years.

* create me a scaffold for a python rest api with flask
